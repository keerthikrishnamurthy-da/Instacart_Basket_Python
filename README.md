# Instacart_Basket_Python
Inastacart is an online grocery store which is used to place orders for groceries using a mobile app. I have used the data of their customers, Order details and product catalog to uncover customer behaviors and  ordering patterns to use it for targetted marketing campaigns to increase sales.
I ahve used the open source data from Instacart basket for this project. Below are the lonks for the same.
